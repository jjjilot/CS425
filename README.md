# CS425
From Syllabus:

The main goal of the course is to introduce you to the different aspects of programming languages, including their features, type systems, programming style, and implementation. We will consider several programming languages: ML, Haskell, Racket, JavaScript, and Prolog. You will not become an expert programmer in the languages taught in this class. However, you will gain the necessary skills to understand the impact of language features on both the implementation and the abstractions they provide. We will cover different programming paradigms: imperative, functional, and logic programming. Each paradigm provides a different way to solve a problem. Note that this is not a survey course!

Languages: You will learn the basic of these languages:

- ML (a statically typed, mostly functional language)
- Racket (a dynamically typed, mostly functional language)
- JavaScript (a dynamically typed, multi-paradigm language) 
- Haskell (a statically typed, pure functional language)
- Prolog (a logic programming language)

On completion, you will have a thorough understanding of the following topics:

- Compilation vs Interpretation: advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed of execution and memory space.
- Syntax vs Semantics: what are the legal expressions and what do expressions mean.
- Imperative programming (Cobol, Fortran, C, Pascal, Ada, Ruby, Phyton): This is the closest model to the machine architecture.
- Functional programming (Racket, ML, Haskell): Based on mathematics which gives a theoretical foundation.
- Deductive programming (Prolog) : Based on the concept of a relation.
- Control mechanisms.
- Implementing a language.
